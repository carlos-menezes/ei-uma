Person (name, age, gender)	name is a key

**1.**

**a.** Find all pizzerias frequented by at least one person under the age of 18.

$
\Pi_{frequents.pizzeria}(\sigma_{person.name = frequents.name \land person.age \lt 18}(frequents \times person))
$

**b.** Find the names of all females who eat either mushroom or pepperoni pizza (or both).

$
\sigma_{person.name = eats.name \ \land \ person.gender = "Female" \ \land\ (  eats.pizza = \text{"Mushroom"} \ \lor \ eats.pizza = \text{"Pineapple"})}\\(person \times eats)
$

**c.** Find the names of all females who eat both mushroom and pepperoni pizza.
$
\sigma_{person.name = eats.name\ \land\ eats.pizza = \text{"Mushroom"}}(person \times eats) \\
\cap \\
\sigma_{person.name = eats.name\ \land\ eats.pizza = \text{"Pineapple"}}(person \times eats) \\
$

**d.** Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza that Amy eats for less than $10.00.

$
\Pi_{serves.pizzeria}\\
(\sigma_{eats.pizza = serves.pizza}\\
(\sigma_{price \lt 10 }(serves) \times \sigma_{name = Amy}(eats)))
$

**e.** Find all pizzerias that are frequented by only females or only males.

$
(\Pi_{frequents.pizzeria}\\
(\sigma_{person.name = frequents.name}\\
(person \times frequents)) \\- \\
\Pi_{frequents.pizzeria}\\(\sigma_{person.name = frequents.name\ \land\ person.gender = Male}\\
(person \times frequents))) \\ \cup \\
(\Pi_{frequents.pizzeria}\\
(\sigma_{person.name = frequents.name}\\
(person \times frequents)) \\- \\
\Pi_{frequents.pizzeria}\\(\sigma_{person.name = frequents.name\ \land\ person.gender = Female}\\
(person \times frequents)))
